Today, algorithms have become an essential skill for all programmers.Whether you're a beginner in the computer industry or a veteran of decades of hard work, algorithms are a topic we can't get around.

Sure, you can write code that runs (which is pretty simple), but if you want to balance the complexity of time with the complexity of space, you need to think seriously.Not only do you have to learn the basic theoretical ideas but you also have to understand the specific processes that are going on, you have to have a deep understanding of how each line of code is going on, and I believe you have to do that systematically.

"Algorithm" (the fourth edition) is a good book (English version) including sorting, search, tree, graph, string and so on several modules, is too important for the basic learning, often I do not understand the knowledge points, can always find a microcosm above, so as to solve my problems.Of course we can't carry it with us all the time, and it's over 600 pages long, but it's too slow (for me) to access the corresponding website.Many of these things are far less practical than books.Therefore, in order to be able to quickly find the corresponding chapter and corresponding code when encountering the same problem again, I want to make a record of the above important algorithm ideas and theories.

For the essence of this book is its illustrations, almost all can let us understand more thorough picture is recorded, and relative to the physical book is colorful, more conducive to us to understand and digest absorb, so I will also to the book will be able to help people understand and digest the illustrations are a record of their understanding.At the same time, the corresponding module will be added in the future when the corresponding topic of LeetCode is scanned

This warehouse will be maintained and updated all the time, if you feel that the writing can help you, welcome to give a little star.

时值今日，算法已经成为所有程序员必不可少的一项基本功。无论你是初入计算机行业的小白，亦或是勤勤恳恳耕耘了数十年的大佬，算法却都是我们绕不开的话题。

你当然可以写出可以跑起来的代码（这是非常的简单），但是若是想要兼顾时间复杂度的同时又要注意空间复杂度的问题，就需要我们进行一番认认真真的考量。你不但要学习基本的理论思想还要明白具体的运行流程，深入理解每一行代码的运行过程，我相信还是要进行系统性的学习。

《算法》（第四版）是一本好书（英文版）囊括了排序，搜索，树，图，字符串等几大模块，对于基础性的学习也是太重要了，每每我有不是很明白的知识点，总能在上面找到缩影，从而解决我的问题。当然我们不可能随时都带着它，全书也有六百多页，但是对于对应的官网而言（于我自己而言）访问起来太慢太慢。其中很多的东西远远没有书本来的实在于简单易行。所以本着自己能够再遇到相同的问题能够快速找到对应的章节和对应的代码而言，想着进行一个记录，将上面的重要的算法思想和理论进行一个记录。

对于这本书的精华来说就是其插图，几乎所有能够让我们理解更加透彻的图片都有记录，而且相对于实体书而言是彩色的，更加利于我们去理解与消化吸收，所以我也将立志将书中能够帮助大家理解和消化的插图都进行一个自己的理解的记录。同时也会在未来在刷LeetCode相对应的题目时候进行对应模块的加入

对于这个仓库也会一直进行维护和更新，如果感觉写的还可以对大家有帮助，欢迎给个小星星。
